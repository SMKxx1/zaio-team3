# Zaio by Team 3


## Changes so far:
    Added:
    + Spacing to the nav items
    + Reversing animation to the web icons
    + Animations to the Sign-in/Sign-up buttons
    + Spacing at the top and the bottom of #hero
    + Added text-blue to Zaio in Why Zaio?

    Removed:
    - The Sign-up form (Since there is a Get Started button in the nav bar, I did not see a need to have a form. 
      The same form is already situated at the bottom of the page.)
